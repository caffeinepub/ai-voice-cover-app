  "summary": "All five requirements (REQ-32 through REQ-36) have been successfully implemented. The frontend adds a music style prompt input with clickable keyword suggestions in GenerationMode, and the backend extends the LyricsRequest data model with an optional stylePrompt field. The implementation includes proper state management, submission flow, and backward compatibility via a migration module.",

The migration module transforms old LyricsRequest records to include the new stylePrompt field, which was not specified in any requirement.",

While some were mentioned as examples in REQ-33, the requirement only mandates the five listed keywords.",
