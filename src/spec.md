# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the maximum character limit on lyrics input while keeping the minimum requirement.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the 2,000 character maximum validation from the LyricsInput component
- Update the character count display to show only the current count without a maximum
- Keep the 20 character minimum requirement intact

**User-visible outcome:** Users can enter unlimited lyrics text (minimum 20 characters) without hitting a character limit or seeing validation errors for long lyrics.
