# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enable streamlined persona-based workflow where users can select a persona and immediately create songs (cover or lyrics generation), with automatic library saving and social media sharing to Facebook and YouTube.

**Planned changes:**
- Update persona selection flow to prompt for cover mode or generation mode, then navigate directly to song upload or lyrics input with pre-selected persona
- Automatically save all completed songs to the library without requiring manual save action
- Add social media sharing buttons to Library view for Facebook and YouTube
- Implement Facebook sharing integration to post songs with metadata to user's feed
- Implement YouTube upload integration with title, description, and privacy settings

**User-visible outcome:** Users can select a persona, instantly start creating a cover or generating a song with that persona, have all songs automatically saved to their library, and share songs directly to Facebook or upload them to YouTube from the Library view.
