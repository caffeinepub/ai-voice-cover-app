  "summary": "The diff implements comprehensive debugging and library save fixes for both cover and generation modes. Console logging has been added throughout App.tsx, useProcessingStatus, useGenerationStatus, and GenerationMode. Backend functions (createCover, submitLyricsRequest, completeLyricsRequest) are called with proper parameters. Query invalidation and error handling with toast notifications are present. The implementation addresses all requirements with extensive logging and proper data flow.",

      "reason": "REQ-57 requires invalidating React Query cache for immediate display, but does not request a polling/refetch interval mechanism. The refetchInterval adds continuous background polling that was not specified in the requirements.",
